#### A web app for enhanced productivity!

<img src="/app/assets/gifs/example.gif">

* Based on the popular **[Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)**:
  * Assign yourself a **to-do list** for your work session.
  * Organize your work flow into periods of **work** and **breaks**.
  * Use this Pomodoro web app to track your **ambitions** and **accomplishments** for any given work session while **managing your time** meaningfully.



## Welcome To Better Time Management

* Work flow is broken into **work** and **break** sessions:
  * **Work** session [25min]
  * **Break** session [5min]
  * **Long Break** session [30min] (after every 4th completed **work** session)

## 1. Add Tasks

* Visualized **tasks** help reinforce the **purpose** and **intent** of your work session while lending some **estimation** of the path in front of you:
  * Type new tasks into the **task pane** on the left
  * Press **Enter** or click on the **+** button to add them to your active tasks

## 2. Start the Timer

## 3. Mark Tasks Completed

* When you're finished with a task, you can mark them **completed** by selecting the **checkbox** to its left.

* **Completed tasks** will gather at the **bottom** of the list of **active tasks**, offering visualization of your accomplishments and a sense of the part of the hill climbed.

* To dismiss your **completed tasks**, select the **trash** icon.


## 4. Take a Break

* Once you've **completed** a work session, it's time to **take a break**! The timer will **reset** to the appropriate break session:
  * **Break** [5mins]
  * **Long Break** [30mins] (after every 4th completed **work** session)
* You have the option to skip your break if you're feeling extra ambitious.


## Persistent Tasks

* **Guest users** can benefit in much the same ways as their counterparts, but by personalizing your experience with an **account**, you can **keep your tasks** from session to session.

* **User Authentication** is handled by **[Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)**.

## Responsive Design

* And of course, take the Pomodoro web app with you, thanks to its **mobile-first design** approach.
